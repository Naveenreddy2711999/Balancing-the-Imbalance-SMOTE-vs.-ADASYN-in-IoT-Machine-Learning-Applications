# Balancing-the-Imbalance-SMOTE-vs.-ADASYN-in-IoT-Machine-Learning-Applications
This project compares SMOTE and ADASYN oversampling techniques to handle class imbalance in the BoT-IoT dataset for IoT attack detection. Four ML models—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM—were trained to identify the best model and technique for accurate intrusion detection.
